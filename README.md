Simple website for js testing

This website essentially functions as a counter, in this case we can call it a counter for the number of people entering a building.

The start button starts the time and shows you when you started counting people.

The add 1 button adds a person (or thing) to the number recorded.

The save button saves the number into the table below and ends the first sample with an end time.
